CONSOLE MESSAGE: [blocked] The page at data:text/html,<html><script src='http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/mixedContent/resources/script.js'></script></html> requested insecure content from http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/mixedContent/resources/script.js. This content was blocked and must be served over HTTPS.

This test opens a window that loads a data: iframe that loads an insecure script, and that the script is still blocked. Although the data: frame has a separate origin, the script can still navigate top.
