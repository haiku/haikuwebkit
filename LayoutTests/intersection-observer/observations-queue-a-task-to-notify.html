     * This dance deserves some comment.
     * What we are trying to do is test that an intersection observation queued a task
     * to run the callback instead of running it during the "update the rendering" step where
     * the interesection was computed. In order to do that, we need the "update the rendering"
     * algorithm to have run once and any observation tasks queued during that step to have not run.
     * The way to accomplish this is earlier in the update the rendering steps we queue a task
     * that will perform the final check. Since rAF callbacks are run before updating intersection
     * observations we can queue a task from there which checks that the div has not yet been mutated.
     * Unfortunately a zero delay timer does not run before the Event Loop's task queue so we can't use
     * UIHelper.renderingUpdate which does approximately this sequence of steps but with Web APIs.
